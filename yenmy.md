# Reflection
What was the most useful feedback that your group received?

The most useful feedback was about our architecture. There was suggestions on which format we should show the architecture (diagram, written paragraph, or bullet points). After receiving the feedback we concluded that a diagram would be best for our specific project. 

Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?

As my main role is coding, I think I need to make sure the architecture of how everything works is clearly established with my team members. I will work on an architecture diagram as we don't have that fully made at the momment. 

Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class, what is one technnique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?

I found it really cool how one group incorporated a physical visual in addition to their web app. In the future, I would also like to see how I could create something in real life to go along with the virtual creation.
