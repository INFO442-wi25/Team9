            "Professor Santiago: Carla! What a surprise. And who’s this?",

            "Professor Santiago: This is the closest thing we have to a guide. The Llanganates are unpredictable—you’ll need more than luck.",
            "Carla: This is incredible!",
            "Professor Santiago: If you want to find the treasure, head towards the town. Talk with the people they'll give more stories about the treasure.",
            "Carla: Do you think we’ll be able to make it through the forest?",
            "Professor Santiago: The forest will be tough. You’ll need to keep an eye out for any wild animals. Follow the marks on the trees and find the cave by the river. This should lead you right to it.",
            "Ale: Thank you, Professor. This is exactly what we needed.",
            "Professor Santiago: Just remember, there are forces at work in those mountains that you’ll never understand. Stay safe and good luck.",

            "Ale: I know it’s risky, but I’m willing to try. I need guidance, and I’ve heard you’re the expert.",
            "Professor Santiago: Hah, I like your determination. I can give you some directions, but the treasure is not something you can just walk up to. It’s hidden, guarded by time and nature.",
            "Professor Santiago: If you want to start your journey, head towards the town. From there, the people should tell you more stories about the treasure. Keep an eye out for marks on trees and a cave by the river. This should lead you right to it.",
            "Ale: Sounds like a lot of ground to cover. How do I know I’m heading in the right direction?",
            "Professor Santiago: Cross the river. When you see a waterfall, you’ll know you're close. That’s when the real challenge begins.",
            "Ale: I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you for your help.",
            "Professor Santiago: Take this map with you. It’s not much, but it’s the only one we have. Remember there is danger all around you.",
            "Ale: Got it. I’ll be careful. This is just the beginning.",
            "Professor Santiago: Good luck, Ale. If you need more help, you know where to find me.",
